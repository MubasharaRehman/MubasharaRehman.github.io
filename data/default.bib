abstract = {While the concept of responsible AI is becoming more and more popular, practitioners and researchers may often struggle to characterize responsible practices in their own work. This paper presents a four-day, PhD-level course on Responsible Artificial Intelligence conducted at the University of Udine by Dr. Damiano Spina. Using a hands-on approach, the course aimed to illustrate the application of responsible AI concepts in research. Using case studies based on existing IR research, the course explored responsible AI concepts such as positionality, participatory research, fairness, diversity, and ethics. The course engaged 23 participants, both online and in person, including PhD students at various stages, postdoctoral researchers, professors, and academic staff. It featured four sessions and five interactive group activities. Of the 23 attendees, 20 (87\%) actively participated in the activities, and 14 (61\%) completed the final survey. We believe the hands-on activities discussed in this paper can assist practitioners and educators in the design of responsible AI content for information retrieval curriculum.Date: May 21--24, 2024.Website: https://www.damianospina.com/teaching/responsible-ai.},

abstract = {In the last few decades, deep learning is already being widely used to yield excellent performance, automate processes, pattern detection and natural language processing. Among different types of deep neural networks, convolutional neural network has been most extensively studied. In this study, the authors have introduced a network architecture named Fast Unit of Optical Flow (FUOF), which enables the network to estimate optical flow through a fast and robust approach. Our proposed method, FUOF based on the updating of FlowNetC, which includes a layer that correlates feature vectors at different image locations. We also introduced the Extended Sobel method to extract the spatial information to optimize further computation time. Moreover, to fuse the spatial and temporal information flexibly and comprehensively, two different fuse networks are defined as FUOF-Sum and FUOF-Concat in our study. The fuse mode's main difference is on the summarizing of each channel for concatenating of channels for the feature extraction this simple yet powerful idea validated by the experiments with MPI Sintel and Flying Chairs datasets. According to our results, the network with FUOF can achieve a competitive efficiency on the accuracy of standard error measure, convergence speed, and robustness for optical flow estimation.},
